# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview
This purpose of this analysis is to determine how many current employees of Pewlett-Hackard are within retirement age so that the company will know how to prepare for the shift in workforce. Knowing how many employees will be retiring will give the company an idea of how many new employees they will need to recruit and train to keep the business running smoothly. Preparing now will give them an edge and offer the pre-retirement employees an option to help train their replacements through a mentorship.

## Summary
With over 90,000 employees exiting and nearly 2,000 eligible for mentorship, it would be beneficial for the company to gain further insight and potentially expand the age of the mentors. A larger mentor group would allow them to give proper training to the new recruits. The company can utilize the table in deliverable 2 to determine where more mentors and recruits are needed throughout the nine departments. Further filtration of the current data sets (taking out those that are not current employees) will provide more accurate forecasts of retirees and potential mentors.
